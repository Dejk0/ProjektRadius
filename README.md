This solution in the future can simulate your move on the track with a gocart or a bike.

With this we can calculate the laptime and the line where you went.

The solution is simple. Have MAUI app what can collelt the geolocations and the phone orientaion. 
At first need the anyhow lock to the bike/gocart body. After this just start the app.

If we goes some lap we stop the app and write the angel and location to "download" dierctory.
In the DoriGE we need loadin these datas and rotate and translate the models in the track space. 

In the future may it have collusion check in the finish line. This will alow the app to mansure lap time and sector times.
